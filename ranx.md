# Randomness with Ranx

---

Working with data science projects, there are many occasions that you need gazillions of good quality random numbers and you need them fast. So, why not get them in parallel with [Ranx](xref:ranx)?

Back in 2023, I developed a parallel random number generator library named [p2rng](https://github.com/arminms/p2rng) and delivered a [Compute Ontario Colloquia](https://www.computeontario.ca/training-colloquia) talk about it. Fast forward to 2025, [p2rng](https://github.com/arminms/p2rng) reincarnated as [Ranx](xref:ranx) with new features.
