This is the home of an [executable book](https://executablebooks.org/) project about using _Modern_ <wiki:C++> for [high-performance](wiki:High-performance_computing) <wiki:data_science>.

It's a companion to a series of talks by [Armin Sobhani](https://armin.sobhani.me) for the [Compute Ontario Colloquia](https://www.computeontario.ca/training-colloquia).

It'll be updated as more talks in the series are delivered.

## C++ vs. Python for Data Science

::::{grid} 1 1 2 2

:::{card}
:header: 😌 **Ease of Use** 
:footer: **Winner**: `Python`🥇

- <wiki:C++> has a steeper learning curve and more complex syntax compared to `Python` 👎
- [Python](wiki:Python_language)'s syntax is simple and readable, making it accessible for beginners 👍
:::

:::{card}
:header: 📚 **Community and Libraries** 
:footer: **Winner**: `Python`🥇

- <wiki:C++>'s ecosystem is not as extensive as `Python`'s for data science 👎
- [Python](wiki:Python_language) has extensive libraries like <wiki:NumPy>, [Pandas](wiki:Pandas_(software)), <wiki:Matplotlib>, etc. and a large and active community 👍
:::

:::{card}
:header: 🏃 **Performance** 
:footer: **Winner**: `C++`🥇

- <wiki:C++> is known for its high performance and efficiency 👍
- [Python](wiki:Python_language) is generally slower than _C++_ due to its interpreted nature 👎
:::

:::{card}
:header: 🔀 **Concurrency** 
:footer: **Winner**: `C++`🥇

- <wiki:C++> has built-in support for [concurrency](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread) (`C++11`) and [parallel algorithms](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm#Execution_policies) (`C++17`) 👍
- [Python](wiki:Python_language)'s <wiki:global_interpreter_lock> can be a limitation for multi-threaded applications 👎
:::

:::{card}
:header: 💼 **Memory Management** 
:footer: **Winner**: `C++`🥇

- <wiki:C++> : offers fine-grained control over memory management, which can be crucial for large-scale data processing 👍
- [Python](wiki:Python_language) offers less control compared to `C++` 👎
:::

:::{card}
:header: 💫 **Rapid Prototyping** 
:footer: **Winner**: `Python`🥇
:link: ./xeus-cling/about.md

- <wiki:C++>'s compiled nature makes it a lackluster 👎
- [Python](wiki:Python_language)'s interpreted nature combined with <wiki:Project_Jupyter> makes it a perfect match for the job 👍
